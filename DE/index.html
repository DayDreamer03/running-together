        Let’s be honest: the world has gone crazy... and so have we. We’re Simon
        and Victor, two brothers on a mission to run the Paris 2025 Marathon.
        Our goal is simple - to raise €10 for every kilometer we run. We all had
        our share of hospital visits, we know how hard it can be for patients,
        staff and helpers.

        Public hospitals are the last place of hope for so many. And guess what?
        They’re struggling. The staff? They’re exhausted, overworked, and
        underappreciated. Your donation isn't just cash – it's a lifeline. 100%
        of the funds collected will go straight to the
        <a href="https://www.aktionsbuendnis-gesundheit.de/"
          >Aktionsbündnis Gesundheit</a
        >, in other words: improving conditions, buying equipment, and
        supporting the well-being of our docs.

      <p>
        Here’s the deal: our marathon and your donation isn't going to change
        the game. We're a drop in an ocean of debt. But it's a small gesture to
        thank the people who show up for us every single day. ❤️
